## MirageOS Website

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mirage/mirage-www.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mirage/mirage-www)

This repository contains the MirageOS public website, <https://mirage.io/>.

It provides information about the project as well as the blog and wiki.

It also serves as a good first self-hosting test case.

### Building with Docker

The easiest way to get started is to build using Docker:

```
docker build -t mirage-www .
docker run --rm -it --init -p 80:8080 mirage-www ./www --http-port 8080
```

Then browse to <http://127.0.0.1/>.

You can build for other targets with e.g. `docker build --build-arg TARGET=hvt ...`.

### Building without Docker

To build this website, first use `make prepare`
You can then build the mirage application in the src/ directory:
```
cd src && mirage configure && make
```

### Configuration

For unikernel configuration options, use `mirage configure --help` in `src`.

To update, send a pull request. When successfully merged, the Travis CI scripts,
fetched from <https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml-travisci-skeleton/>, will cause the
generated Xen unikernel to be committed back to the
<https://github.com/mirage/mirage-www-deployment> repo.
